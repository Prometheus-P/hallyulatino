# Feature Specification: Content Search

**Feature Branch**: `001-content-search`
**Created**: 2025-12-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Internal search functionality to search across all content collections (dramas, kpop, noticias, guias) with real-time filtering and SEO-friendly search results page"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Content Search (Priority: P1)

A visitor wants to find specific content on the site. They enter a search term and see matching results from all content types (dramas, kpop, noticias, guias) displayed on a dedicated search results page.

**Why this priority**: Search is the core functionality. Without basic search working, no other search features have value. This delivers immediate user value by helping visitors find content quickly.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering a search query and verifying matching results appear. Delivers the primary value of content discovery.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor on any page, **When** they enter "BTS" in the search field and submit, **Then** they see a results page showing all articles mentioning "BTS" across all collections.
2. **Given** a visitor on the search results page, **When** results are displayed, **Then** each result shows the article title, collection type (drama/kpop/noticia/guia), excerpt, and publication date.
3. **Given** a visitor searches for a term, **When** no matching content exists, **Then** they see a friendly "no results" message with suggestions to broaden their search.

### User Story 2 - Real-Time Search Suggestions (Priority: P2)

A visitor typing in the search field sees instant suggestions/results updating as they type, without needing to press Enter or click a button.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user experience by providing immediate feedback, but the site is functional without it. Builds on P1's foundation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by typing characters in the search field and observing results update without page reload or form submission.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor focuses on the search field, **When** they type at least 2 characters, **Then** matching results begin appearing within 300ms.
2. **Given** a visitor is typing, **When** they pause typing, **Then** results update to reflect the current query.
3. **Given** a visitor sees real-time results, **When** they click a result, **Then** they navigate directly to that article.

---

### User Story 3 - Filter by Content Type (Priority: P3)

A visitor on the search results page wants to narrow down results to a specific content type (e.g., only K-Dramas or only news articles).

**Why this priority**: Filtering improves discoverability for users with specific interests, but basic search (P1) already provides value. This is an enhancement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by performing a search, then selecting a filter and verifying only that content type appears in results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor viewing search results, **When** they select the "K-Dramas" filter, **Then** only drama articles appear in the results.
2. **Given** a visitor has applied a filter, **When** they select "Todos" (All), **Then** results from all content types appear again.
3. **Given** a visitor applies a filter, **When** no results match the filter, **Then** they see a message indicating no results for that content type.

### User Story 4 - SEO-Friendly Search Results Page (Priority: P4)

Search results pages with query parameters are discoverable by search engines, allowing users to find OndaCoreana through Google searches like "ondacoreana BTS".

**Why this priority**: Important for SEO goals but depends on search functionality (P1) existing first. Enhances organic traffic acquisition.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing a search URL directly (e.g., `/buscar?q=BTS`) and verifying the page renders with proper meta tags.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a search results URL like `/buscar?q=BTS`, **When** accessed directly, **Then** the page renders with results for "BTS" pre-populated.
2. **Given** a search results page, **When** viewed by search engine crawlers, **Then** proper meta tags (title, description, canonical) reflect the search query.
3. **Given** a visitor shares a search results URL, **When** another user opens it, **Then** they see the same search results.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user searches with special characters (e.g., Korean text "방탄소년단")?
- Long search queries (100+ characters) are truncated at 100 characters with a notification to the user.
- What happens when a user searches for content that exists but is marked as draft?
- How does search behave when the search index is empty or unavailable?
- Searches with fewer than 2 non-whitespace characters show a prompt to enter more characters; no search is executed.
- When the search index fails to load, the system displays "Error al cargar los resultados de búsqueda" with a suggestion to try again later.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-02

- Q: How many search results to display initially and per load? → A: 10 results initially, load 10 more on scroll
- Q: How should the system handle very long search queries? → A: Truncate at 100 characters with user notification
- Q: How should empty/whitespace-only queries be handled? → A: Require minimum 2 non-whitespace characters to search

## Assumptions

- Search will operate client-side using a pre-built search index (standard pattern for static sites)
- The search index will be generated at build time from published content
- Korean text search will use standard Unicode matching (not romanization conversion)
- Pagination will use infinite scroll or "load more" pattern rather than numbered pages
- Search analytics/tracking will be handled by existing site analytics (not custom implementation)
